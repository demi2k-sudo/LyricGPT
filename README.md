# LyricGPT
This Model is trained based on the transformer architecture.
A decoder only version of the Transformer model is used as to generate lyrics (make the language model dream data) that is similar to the lyrics provided to the model.
I don't have enough resources and hence have provided the context window size of 8 characters.
The output was kinda okayish but not great.

The output when providing a starting word to the model after 10000 epochs was like,

"Baby, just can't stop the sympathy's apart  
Can I believe your love  
  
Believe your silent day with his dream  
I love you down,  
I love you down too far away  
You wanna not me anyion or  
I can't live your greenough  
I'm gonna live yourself right inside you  
Woman can't mean what armen, I'll mean what a give what I feel.  
So I kiss your jakers to one yet stood, let your basket grown,  
I'm abanzed on high and always fren  
The snow of sight on her was b-shine, baby look up here in the day.  
Baby, just a little voice to be your peek down road where lovers.  
Wish you've never listened around  
Shining down the Lady Dollady  
I hear to crack the redeemade of trying alright that you was rainfor, ? Guess vit,  
And it's trying to smoke."

Ikr that's not making sense but still we could see that the model could understand english and make almost grammatical sentences.
